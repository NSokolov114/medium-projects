Matching game with WoW icons.

GENERAL IDEAS
* decks based on class
* user can set grid 3x3 4x4 5x5, maybe even type grid width and height with some boundaries, up to 10x10.
** if grid has an odd number of cards, 1 card becomes a joker
* grid is generated on the fly. Container's width can be set by the number of cards

* custom backside (img), maybe with filter

? when user guessed right, either hide the cards completely or lock on front side and desaturate

TODO
+ find and download and prepare wow icons
- hardcode a grid
- fill the grid with random images. F.e. 100 images, need to choose NOC/2 images of that pool.
- make sure that's the grid has 2 of each image

ABBREVIATIONS
NOC - number of cards. Either is set by user or calculated if GW+GH is set by the user.
GW - grid width in cards
GH - grid height in cards
